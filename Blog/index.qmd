*How To Be A Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek Reflection*

Writing a scientific paper can be a complex process, but modern tools and approaches can streamline it. One of the most important steps in writing a paper is collaborating effectively with co-authors. Using collaborative software like Google Docs is highly recommended, as it prevents version control issues. Instead of passing around a single document, tools like Google Docs allow real-time collaboration with automatic version saving and comment tracking. These tools make it easy to identify who wrote which parts of the paper and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

When it comes to structuring the content, focusing on figures is essential. Before writing the paper itself, you should create high-quality, publication-ready plots that clearly represent your results. These figures will serve as the focal point of your paper, helping you tell a clear and cohesive story. Once the figures are ready, the writing should revolve around explaining them to your audience. Since many readers tend to focus on the figures first, ensuring they are well-crafted and tell the story is crucial for engaging a wider audience and making your paper more effective.

In terms of writing style, clarity and simplicity should be prioritized. It’s important to write in a way that is accessible, even if this might make your paper slightly harder to publish in some cases. Scientific writing can often be overly complex, but simplifying your language and approach will help make your research understandable to a broader audience. While academic journals may sometimes prefer more technical language, clear communication is key to conveying your ideas effectively and making your paper widely accessible.

Finally, when it comes to publishing, preprints are an excellent way to share your research quickly. Instead of waiting for peer review to be completed, you can post your paper on a preprint server, allowing others to read and comment on your work almost immediately. This not only helps establish precedence for your research but also provides an opportunity for feedback before submission to a journal. By embracing modern publishing tools, you can accelerate the dissemination of your work and engage with the scientific community more effectively.

*Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05 Reflection*

As we delve into this special issue of The American Statistician, some of you might wonder if it’s simply a lecture from statisticians, warning against the misuse of p-values without offering practical solutions for handling the complex challenges of distinguishing signal from noise in data. However, this issue offers far more than warnings; it brings forth 43 papers by innovative statisticians, each contributing valuable ideas aimed at solving the difficult problem of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. This collection represents a forward-thinking shift, acknowledging that we need more than just cautionary advice — we need constructive alternatives.

The focus of the issue is on offering actionable guidance, recognizing that merely highlighting what not to do is not enough. While statisticians have long warned about the dangers of relying on p-values, such as considering p < 0.05 as the ultimate measure of truth, it’s time to build a more nuanced approach to statistical inference. This special issue strives to go beyond just warning about the pitfalls of p-values and aims to provide a roadmap for using statistics in a way that fosters more accurate, reliable, and transparent conclusions. As the voices within these papers reflect differing perspectives, they also suggest that the future of statistics may involve less rigid thresholds and a move toward a richer, more adaptable framework for understanding uncertainty.

One crucial recommendation is the complete abandonment of the term “statistically significant.” Historically, this term has led to confusion, often implying that a result is scientifically important merely because it passes an arbitrary threshold. This binary labeling distorts the understanding of p-values, as it falsely suggests that results either hold significant weight or are entirely irrelevant. The issue calls for a paradigm shift — one where p-values are not treated as definitive measures of truth, but rather as part of a broader context of evidence. In this new world, researchers will have the freedom to engage more critically with their data, allowing for a more thoughtful and honest interpretation of scientific results that acknowledges uncertainty without relying on misleading categorical distinctions.
