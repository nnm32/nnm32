title: "Flavors of the World: Exploring the Art of Indian and Mexican Cooking"

<div style="text-align: justify;">
My interest in cooking began in my mother's kitchen, where I spent countless hours experimenting with flavors and learning the art of adjusting recipes to my liking. I would spend hours perfecting my version of Prego pasta sauce, adding teaspoons of herbs, a whole lot of butter, and making countless tweaks until it tasted just right. It took me a while to realize that true cooking isn’t about exact measurements like teaspoons or cups. Instead, it’s about creating the right balance of flavors and allowing passion to guide the process. Cooking, I learned, is about experimenting with ingredients and flavors, where intuition and heart take the place of precision.

My interest in Indian cooking developed naturally over time, as it embodies many of the comfort foods I cherish. The richness and depth of the spices, the way each dish tells a story, drew me in. Indian recipes have become some of my all-time favorites, and I find myself constantly going back to classic dishes like dal and rice, which have a special place in my heart. There's something incredibly comforting about curling up on the couch with a warm bowl of yellow lentils and rice, savoring the familiar flavors. Indian food not only nourishes the body but also speaks to the soul, with its comforting, hearty dishes and rich cultural heritage.

A few years ago, I watched the movie *Tortilla Soup*, which introduced me to the idea that Mexican cuisine shares a lot of similarities with Indian cuisine. The father in the film was an amazing chef, and through his culinary journey, I saw the common thread of fresh ingredients, vibrant flavors, and a deep passion for food. Like Indian cuisine, Mexican cooking emphasizes fresh produce, bold spices, and a move away from overly processed foods. I realized that both cuisines celebrate the art of cooking with love and using ingredients that highlight the importance of freshness and quality. The two dishes featured on this page are a reflection of my love for both culinary traditions. The vegetable Manchurian with gravy is an Indian street food favorite from Maharashtra, bursting with vibrant colors and equally bold flavors. The second dish is a nourishing bowl of black bean soup, topped with cotija cheese and spinach tortilla chips, drawing inspiration from Mexican cuisine and its rich, fresh ingredients.
