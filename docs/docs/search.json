    "text": "My journey into cooking began as a curious amateur, playing around with simple ingredients like Prego pasta sauce. I’d experiment in the kitchen, adding spices and herbs to make the sauce more interesting, not knowing that this small beginning would eventually spark a lifelong love for cooking. What started as a fun and somewhat chaotic hobby quickly evolved into a more serious pursuit as I tackled more complex recipes. The process of creating something from scratch and sharing it with others became both a challenge and a joy that fueled my passion for exploring the vast world of food.\nToday, I find immense joy in cooking and baking, especially when I get the chance to feed people. I truly believe that the way to anyone’s heart is through their stomach. Whether it’s the delicate art of Japanese cooking, the bold flavors of Indian cuisine, or the vibrant, spicy dishes of Thai and Mexican food, I enjoy immersing myself in different culinary traditions. Indian cooking, in particular, has captured my heart. I rely heavily on Dassana’s Veg Recipes for guidance, as they provide detailed instructions for making flavorful, spice-rich dishes that resonate deeply with my love for bold flavors.\nLooking ahead, I hope to take my passion for food and turn it into something more—a cafe where food is crafted with love, fresh ingredients, and a focus on liberal use of spices. I envision a place where people can experience food made with passion, where the warmth of every dish invites connection and conversation. Coffee and food will come together as an experience, celebrating the diverse ways spices can transform ingredients into something memorable. Cooking is more than just a hobby to me; it’s a way to share stories, traditions, and a piece of my heart with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1: This image shows a recipe called Veg Manchurian, a popular dish made with a mix of all-purpose flour and vegetables, shaped into small balls and served in a tangy, flavorful sauce. This dish is a perfect example of the culinary fusion seen in Mumbai, the city where I was born. Mumbai is a cosmopolitan hub, blending cultures and cuisines from across India and beyond. It’s a melting pot where South Indian, North Indian, West Indian, and East Indian recipes come together, creating a unique food culture that reflects the city’s diversity and vibrancy. Veg Manchurian itself embodies this fusion, combining traditional Indian ingredients with Chinese influences to create a dish that is loved by many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 2: The recipe here is called Black Bean Soup, a dish that holds a special place in my memories. I first encountered the world of Mexican cuisine during high school, in a Spanish class where we watched the movie Tortilla Soup. Beyond simply inspiring me to explore Mexican dishes, the film taught me the value of eating fresh, whole foods rather than relying on processed options. It also highlighted how food has the power to bring people together, particularly within a family setting. The shared meals, the vibrant flavors, and the sense of connection portrayed in the movie made me realize just how deeply food can shape relationships and create memorable experiences. This Black Bean Soup embodies that spirit of nourishment, bringing together simple, fresh ingredients to create something comforting and full of love.\n\n\n\n\nCooking up a blend of flavors, stats, and mindfulness— excited to share it all with you!"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I earned my medical degree from the University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine, in 2019, and went on to complete a residency in Family Medicine until 2023. During my years of clinical training, I realized that my true calling lies in preventive medicine. I am passionate about helping people adopt healthier lifestyles and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes through education and lifestyle modification.\nAs part of my work, I guide patients in adopting healthier eating habits and creating personalized exercise routines that promote long-term well-being. I believe that prevention is key to improving public health, and I aim to incorporate innovative technologies, including bioinformatics, to help track, analyze, and optimize these interventions. My interest in technology comes from the desire to take a more data-driven, scalable approach to healthcare—especially as we move towards a more personalized, preventative model in medicine.\nOutside of work, I am deeply passionate about various creative pursuits, including cooking, sketching, poetry, and painting. My Instagram profile is a collection of memories that reflect these interests, as well as my philosophy on life. I enjoy working at my own pace and often find myself more productive in solo settings rather than large team environments. Recently, I’ve also become more involved in meditation, as I believe it not only enhances my personal well-being but can also be a valuable tool to offer my patients as part of a holistic approach to health.\nIn addition to my professional and creative pursuits, I am an avid reader with a particular fondness for the Tom Clancy series. However, my reading interests are eclectic, and I enjoy exploring books from a wide range of genres. My diverse interests and background in medicine drive my goal of integrating lifestyle medicine with technology, and I am excited to continue exploring how these fields can converge to improve the health of individuals and communities. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\n\nCooking up a blend of flavors, stats, and mindfulness— excited to share it all with you!"

    "text": "Reflections on Statistical Inference: A Modern Approach to Science in 2025\nAuthor: Nihit Navroz Mehta\nHow To Be A Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek Reflection\nWriting a scientific paper can be a complex process, but modern tools and approaches can streamline it. One of the most important steps in writing a paper is collaborating effectively with co-authors. Using collaborative software like Google Docs is highly recommended, as it prevents version control issues. Instead of passing around a single document, tools like Google Docs allow real-time collaboration with automatic version saving and comment tracking. These tools make it easy to identify who wrote which parts of the paper and ensure that everyone is on the same page.\nWhen it comes to structuring the content, focusing on figures is essential. Before writing the paper itself, you should create high-quality, publication-ready plots that clearly represent your results. These figures will serve as the focal point of your paper, helping you tell a clear and cohesive story. Once the figures are ready, the writing should revolve around explaining them to your audience. Since many readers tend to focus on the figures first, ensuring they are well-crafted and tell the story is crucial for engaging a wider audience and making your paper more effective.\nIn terms of writing style, clarity and simplicity should be prioritized. It’s important to write in a way that is accessible, even if this might make your paper slightly harder to publish in some cases. Scientific writing can often be overly complex, but simplifying your language and approach will help make your research understandable to a broader audience. While academic journals may sometimes prefer more technical language, clear communication is key to conveying your ideas effectively and making your paper widely accessible.\nFinally, when it comes to publishing, preprints are an excellent way to share your research quickly. Instead of waiting for peer review to be completed, you can post your paper on a preprint server, allowing others to read and comment on your work almost immediately. This not only helps establish precedence for your research but also provides an opportunity for feedback before submission to a journal. By embracing modern publishing tools, you can accelerate the dissemination of your work and engage with the scientific community more effectively.\nReference: How to Be a Modern Scientist.

However, this issue offers far more than warnings; it brings forth 43 papers by innovative statisticians, each contributing valuable ideas aimed at solving the difficult problem of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. This collection represents a forward-thinking shift, acknowledging that we need more than just cautionary advice — we need constructive alternatives.\nThe focus of the issue is on offering actionable guidance, recognizing that merely highlighting what not to do is not enough. While statisticians have long warned about the dangers of relying on p-values, such as considering p &lt; 0.05 as the ultimate measure of truth, it’s time to build a more nuanced approach to statistical inference. This special issue strives to go beyond just warning about the pitfalls of p-values and aims to provide a roadmap for using statistics in a way that fosters more accurate, reliable, and transparent conclusions. As the voices within these papers reflect differing perspectives, they also suggest that the future of statistics may involve less rigid thresholds and a move toward a richer, more adaptable framework for understanding uncertainty.\nOne crucial recommendation is the complete abandonment of the term “statistically significant.” Historically, this term has led to confusion, often implying that a result is scientifically important merely because it passes an arbitrary threshold. This binary labeling distorts the understanding of p-values, as it falsely suggests that results either hold significant weight or are entirely irrelevant. The issue calls for a paradigm shift — one where p-values are not treated as definitive measures of truth, but rather as part of a broader context of evidence. In this new world, researchers will have the freedom to engage more critically with their data, allowing for a more thoughtful and honest interpretation of scientific results that acknowledges uncertainty without relying on misleading categorical distinctions.\nReference: Wasserstein, R.
