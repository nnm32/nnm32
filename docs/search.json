When I first entered medical school, my focus was primarily on providing personalized care, one patient at a time. However, as I worked more closely with patients and had greater exposure to public health systems, I began to realize that a more holistic, systems-based approach was crucial for addressing broader health challenges. I saw the profound impact of collective health strategies, where tackling issues on a larger scale could improve the lives of many, not just individuals.\nAs I continued to delve into medical practice, I recognized that in order to truly transform healthcare, understanding and manipulating data on a broad scale became essential. I began to appreciate how data could offer insights that were not immediately apparent and how, when handled properly, it could predict trends, guide decision-making, and enhance patient care. This realization marked a significant turning point in my journey, as it opened my eyes to the potential of data in medicine and public health.\nThis newfound appreciation for data drove me to further my knowledge. I took a class in Biostatistics at Case Western, which was a pivotal moment in my academic career. The class ignited a deep passion within me for data analysis, and I became fascinated by the ability to use statistical tools to draw conclusions and forecast outcomes. From that point on, I became a self-proclaimed “data junkie,” constantly exploring how data can revolutionize medical practices, improve patient care, and shape public health strategies.\nDespite my intense interest in medicine and data, I am also a person with a variety of personal passions. Cooking has always been a therapeutic outlet for me. Whenever life gets stressful, I find solace in creating new recipes, often preparing delicious meals for my wife. It’s not just about food—it’s about creativity, stress relief, and joy. In addition to cooking, I enjoy sketching and painting. The images in my head often translate into artwork, giving me a space to express my creativity and unwind.\nWhile my professional and academic pursuits are diverse, my personal interests lean toward the indoors. I often joke that I am an “avid indoorsman,” spending time on activities like cooking, painting, and delving into the fascinating world of data. These eclectic hobbies and interests keep me grounded, allowing me to balance the demands of my career with personal fulfillment. Ultimately, my journey is a blend of medicine, data, creativity, and a love for the simple joys in life. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My interest in cooking began in my mother’s kitchen, where I spent countless hours experimenting with flavors and learning the art of adjusting recipes to my liking. I would spend hours perfecting my version of Prego pasta sauce, adding teaspoons of herbs, a whole lot of butter, and making countless tweaks until it tasted just right. It took me a while to realize that true cooking isn’t about exact measurements like teaspoons or cups. Instead, it’s about creating the right balance of flavors and allowing passion to guide the process. Cooking, I learned, is about experimenting with ingredients and flavors, where intuition and heart take the place of precision.\nMy interest in Indian cooking developed naturally over time, as it embodies many of the comfort foods I cherish. The richness and depth of the spices, the way each dish tells a story, drew me in. Indian recipes have become some of my all-time favorites, and I find myself constantly going back to classic dishes like dal and rice, which have a special place in my heart. There’s something incredibly comforting about curling up on the couch with a warm bowl of yellow lentils and rice, savoring the familiar flavors. Indian food not only nourishes the body but also speaks to the soul, with its comforting, hearty dishes and rich cultural heritage.\nA few years ago, I watched the movie Tortilla Soup, which introduced me to the idea that Mexican cuisine shares a lot of similarities with Indian cuisine. The father in the film was an amazing chef, and through his culinary journey, I saw the common thread of fresh ingredients, vibrant flavors, and a deep passion for food. Like Indian cuisine, Mexican cooking emphasizes fresh produce, bold spices, and a move away from overly processed foods. I realized that both cuisines celebrate the art of cooking with love and using ingredients that highlight the importance of freshness and quality. The two dishes featured on this page are a reflection of my love for both culinary traditions. The vegetable Manchurian with gravy is an Indian street food favorite from Maharashtra, bursting with vibrant colors and equally bold flavors. The second dish is a nourishing bowl of black bean soup, topped with cotija cheese and spinach tortilla chips, drawing inspiration from Mexican cuisine and its rich, fresh ingredients."

    "text": "Reflections on Statistical Inference: A Modern Approach to Science in 2025\nAuthor: Nihit Navroz Mehta\nHow To Be A Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek Reflection\nWriting a scientific paper can be a complex process, but modern tools and approaches can streamline it. One of the most important steps in writing a paper is collaborating effectively with co-authors. Using collaborative software like Google Docs is highly recommended, as it prevents version control issues. Instead of passing around a single document, tools like Google Docs allow real-time collaboration with automatic version saving and comment tracking. These tools make it easy to identify who wrote which parts of the paper and ensure that everyone is on the same page.\nWhen it comes to structuring the content, focusing on figures is essential. Before writing the paper itself, you should create high-quality, publication-ready plots that clearly represent your results. These figures will serve as the focal point of your paper, helping you tell a clear and cohesive story. Once the figures are ready, the writing should revolve around explaining them to your audience. Since many readers tend to focus on the figures first, ensuring they are well-crafted and tell the story is crucial for engaging a wider audience and making your paper more effective.\nIn terms of writing style, clarity and simplicity should be prioritized. It’s important to write in a way that is accessible, even if this might make your paper slightly harder to publish in some cases. Scientific writing can often be overly complex, but simplifying your language and approach will help make your research understandable to a broader audience. While academic journals may sometimes prefer more technical language, clear communication is key to conveying your ideas effectively and making your paper widely accessible.\nFinally, when it comes to publishing, preprints are an excellent way to share your research quickly. Instead of waiting for peer review to be completed, you can post your paper on a preprint server, allowing others to read and comment on your work almost immediately. This not only helps establish precedence for your research but also provides an opportunity for feedback before submission to a journal. By embracing modern publishing tools, you can accelerate the dissemination of your work and engage with the scientific community more effectively.\nReference: How to Be a Modern Scientist. Lean Publishing; 2016:3-13.

However, this issue offers far more than warnings; it brings forth 43 papers by innovative statisticians, each contributing valuable ideas aimed at solving the difficult problem of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. This collection represents a forward-thinking shift, acknowledging that we need more than just cautionary advice — we need constructive alternatives.\nThe focus of the issue is on offering actionable guidance, recognizing that merely highlighting what not to do is not enough. While statisticians have long warned about the dangers of relying on p-values, such as considering p &lt; 0.05 as the ultimate measure of truth, it’s time to build a more nuanced approach to statistical inference. This special issue strives to go beyond just warning about the pitfalls of p-values and aims to provide a roadmap for using statistics in a way that fosters more accurate, reliable, and transparent conclusions. As the voices within these papers reflect differing perspectives, they also suggest that the future of statistics may involve less rigid thresholds and a move toward a richer, more adaptable framework for understanding uncertainty.\nOne crucial recommendation is the complete abandonment of the term “statistically significant.” Historically, this term has led to confusion, often implying that a result is scientifically important merely because it passes an arbitrary threshold. This binary labeling distorts the understanding of p-values, as it falsely suggests that results either hold significant weight or are entirely irrelevant. The issue calls for a paradigm shift — one where p-values are not treated as definitive measures of truth, but rather as part of a broader context of evidence. In this new world, researchers will have the freedom to engage more critically with their data, allowing for a more thoughtful and honest interpretation of scientific results that acknowledges uncertainty without relying on misleading categorical distinctions.\nReference: Wasserstein, R.
